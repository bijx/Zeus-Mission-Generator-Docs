# `Info` Command

`/info`

The `info` command tells a user specific information about their generation profiles such as their total number of generations and their tokens balance.

## Tokens

In order to prevent over-use of the generation system while it is still in beta, a token system exists to provide a maximum number of generations per account that uses the system. Each token is equal to one generation, and the total number of tokens a user starts with can fluctuate as the beta process progresses (currently set to `20`).

In the future, there will be a way to acquire more tokens. If you have used all your tokens and would like to continue using the bot during beta, send an email to `zmgbot@zeusmissiongen.com` with your Discord username + tag, and some details on your request.

## Output

The resulting embed with your user details is ephemeral, meaning it can only be seen by you.
